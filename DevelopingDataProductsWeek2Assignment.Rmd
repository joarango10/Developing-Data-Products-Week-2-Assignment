## Instuctions

Instructions
Create a web page using R Markdown that features a map created with Leaflet.

Host your webpage on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities.

Your webpage must contain the date that you created the document, and it must contain a map created with Leaflet. We would love to see you show off your creativity!


## Review criteria

The rubric contains the following two questions:

1. Does the web page feature a date and is this date less than two months before the date that youâ€™re grading this assignment?

2. Does the web page feature an interactive map that appears to have been created with Leaflet?

## My Submission

Popular touristy destinations in NYC. 

```{r}
library(leaflet)
my_map <- leaflet() %>% 
  addTiles() %>%
  addMarkers(lat =  40.741112, lng=-73.989723, popup="Flatiron Building") %>% 
  addMarkers(lat = 40.706001, lng= -73.997002, popup="Brooklyn Bridge") %>%
